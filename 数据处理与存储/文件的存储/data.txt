10“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”

She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.”
14“I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living.”
15“I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.”
16“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.”

28“Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere.”
29“One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain.”
30“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.”
31“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”

48“It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.”
49“Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.”
50“There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature.”
51“Do one thing every day that scares you.”
52“I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love.”

But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”
